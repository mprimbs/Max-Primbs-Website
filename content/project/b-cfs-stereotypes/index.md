Human face perception is complex and multifaceted. The speed and accuracy with which we detect, recognize and process faces is influenced by many factors, including lower-level visual factors (such as size or brightness) and higher-level cognitive factors (such as self-relevance or familiarity). My work hereby mostly focusses on the effects of stereotypes. For example, in one series of projects we first investigated how face masks influence emotion recognition ([Rinck, Primbs, Verpaalen, & Bijlstra, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-022-00430-5)) and later followed up with work on how face masks influence the stereotype effect in emotion recognition ([Primbs, Rinck, Holland, Knol, Wies, & Bijlstra, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2022.104394)) In another project we investigated how the role of threat in the initial detection of faces (Bijlstra, Primbs, Mosannenzadeh, & Holland, in prep.). Across four studies we showed that priming threat facilitates the detection of ethnic out-group faces stereotypically associated with threat, but not of other out-group faces. This research line was the first to show that stereotypes can affect the initial detection of faces.
