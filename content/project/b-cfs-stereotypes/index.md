title: "Threat modulates the in-group bias in face detection"
summary: "In this project, we investigated the role of threat in the initial detection of faces. Across four studies we showed that priming participants with stereotype-congruent primes facilitates the detection of out-groups stereotypically associated with threat, but not of other out-groups."

On-going project in the write-up phase in which we investigated the role of threat in the initial detection of faces. Caucasian participants were presented with Dutch, Moroccan, and Asian faces using the breaking continuous flash suppression paradigm. Across four studies, we showed that participants show an in-group bias in face detection (replication of prior work; Study 1) and that this in-group bias can be modulated by activating stereotypical associations between Moroccans and danger (Study 2). Moreover, we showed that merely activating the concept of Morocco already facilitates the detection of Moroccan faces (Study 3), whereas activating the concept Asia does lead to enhanced detection of Asian faces (Study 4). We conclude that stereotypical-associations between Moroccans and danger drive the enhanced detection of Moroccan faces in Study 2 and 3. The present study is the first to show that stereotypes influence the initial detection of faces. This project served as my Honours thesis (Study 1-3) for which I was awarded the grade 9.5 (Dutch System).
