title: "Improving psychological science"
summary: "This research line summarizes my work on improving psychological science - by means of meta-science, commentaries, workshops, and presentations. My main focus here is data pre-processing and multiverse analysis, but I also work on psychological theories, effect sizes, and scientific translation."




This project consists of a series of workshops IÂ´m giving together with Leonhard Volz for the Dutch National Open Science Festival. The aim of the workshops is to increase awareness for the massive effects data pre-processing can have on the outcomes of your statistical tests. We programmed a Shiny app that allows participants to explore the impact of various data transformation and outlier removal techniques. "

Psychological science recently faced a reckoning: Researchers slowly began to realize that the way in which they did research was not particularly well suited to discover new knowledge. Psychological theories are often weak and non-specific, our measurements are unreliable and invalid, and researchers often analysed data until they found the desired result (a practice known as p-hacking). In this research line, I contribute to an extensive literature suggesting solutions to this ever growing number of problems. My focus here is on data pre-processing and multiverse analyses. Through scientific research demonstrating that data pre-processing decisions massively influence statistical results and theoretical conclusions ([Primbs, Holland, Quandt, & Bijlstra, in prep.](https://osf.io/9gj8v/)), Shiny Apps for teaching, and conference and invited talks I try to highlight that all of the small decisions researchers make when analysing their data can impact the conclusions they draw from their experiments. In other work, I caution readers against misinterpreting effect sizes (Primbs et al., under review) and contributed to work demonstrating the careless use of theories in psychological science (McPhetres et al., 2021). I also regularly contribute to large team science projects and serve as Assistant Director for Translation and Cultural Diversity at the PSychological Science Accelerator.
