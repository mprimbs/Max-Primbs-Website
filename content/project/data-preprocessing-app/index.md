For me, one of the most fun aspects of doing research is learning new methods and sharing these methods with other people. Throughout my studies and PhD, I had the opportunity to learn from and collaborate with various methodologists and statisticians and to contribute to various research lines. 

In a first research line, I explored the impact of data pre-processing decisions on statistical outcomes. We found that data pre-processing decisions massively influence statistical results and theoretical conclusions ([Primbs, Holland, Quandt, & Bijlstra, in prep.](https://osf.io/9gj8v/)) and provide a checklist ([Loenneker et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2023.11.012)) for transparent data pre-processing. I also frequently give talks on data pre-processing and multiverse analyses and developed a [Shiny app for teaching](https://levolz.shinyapps.io/data_pre-processing/) about data pre-processing.

In a second research line, I'm thinking about effect size interpretation. What does an effect size actually mean? And what is the smallest effect size I care about, the smallest effect size of interest? In a first paper, we caution readers against misinterpreting effect sizes and highlight the importance of interpretating effect sizes relative to meaningful comparison standards ([Primbs et al., 2024a](https://doi.org/10.1177/17456916221100420)). We continue this research line by arguing for the need for consensus meetings to establish field-specific smallest effect sizes of interest ([Primbs et al., 2024b](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0140525X23002248 )) and providing tools for establishing a smallest effect size of interest for researchers with little statistical training ([Peetz et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.62372/ISCI6112))

Currently, I'm learning about causal inference and am sharing my newly learned knowledge by writing tutorials on causal inference methods aimed at people new to causal inference ([Primbs et al., 2024c](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/mda97)).

 I also regularly contribute to large team science projects and serve as Assistant Director for Translation and Cultural Diversity at the PSychological Science Accelerator. In this capacity, I have contributed to many large-scale research projects, including two last-authored projects in [PNAS](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.2111091119) and [Nature Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01811-7).
