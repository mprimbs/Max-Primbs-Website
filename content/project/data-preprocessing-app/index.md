title: "The importance of data pre-processing"
summary: "This project consists of a series of workshops I give together with Leonhard Volz at the Dutch National Open Science Festival. The aim of the workshops is to increase awareness for the massive effects data pre-processing can have on the outcomes of your statistical tests. We programmed a Shiny app that allows participants to explore the impact of various data transformation and outlier removal techniques. "
