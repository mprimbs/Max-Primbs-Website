The Bias of Crowds model (Payne et al., 2017) suggests that (implicit) bias is determined by the social, cultural and physical environment. The model is supported by a wide range of research findings, linking implicit bias on a geographical level such as counties or states with differences in discriminatory behaviour. I argue that one of the main components of the social and cultural environment, and thus of implicit bias and discriminatory behaviour, is social norms. Social norms describe your beliefs about what others think about an issue or think you should do in a given situation. In this research line I will change and highlight social norms with the aim to facilitate diversity and inclusion and to reduce prejudice.
