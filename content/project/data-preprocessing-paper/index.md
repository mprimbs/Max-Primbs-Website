title: "Data Pre-Processing Distorts Results and Conclusions in Reaction Time Data"
summary: "In this project we conducted a survey of all published papers employing breaking continuous flash suppression to investigate how researchers in the field pre-process and analyse their data. We found that there are almost as many unique data pre-processing-analysis combinations as there are papers. Moreover, we investigated whether the choice of pre-processing pathway influences the outcomes of statistical tests by comparing 6 selected pathways across 10 datasets. We show that data pre-processing massively influences results and conclusions for Frequentist, Bayesian, and meta-analytic analysis techniques."
