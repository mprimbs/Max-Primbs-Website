title: "Data Pre-Processing Distorts Results and Conclusions in Reaction Time Data"
summary: "Breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS) has been established as an important tool in the study of consciousness and visual perception. Past reviews and re-analyses of highly disputed datasets indicate that the findings and conclusions of studies employing b-CFS may strongly be affected by the way the data is pre-processed and analyzed (Moors & Hesselmann, 2018b). In the current review we (1) establish the prevalence of all pre-processing techniques and analysis pathways employed in the b-CFS literature (2) discuss the theoretical reasoning behind these choices and (3) show that data-processing indeed drastically affects reportable statistical outcomes for several analysis pathways across multiple datasets. Finally, we conclude with several recommendations to researchers employing b-CFS and other reaction time-based measures, to promote theoretically grounded, replicable data pre-processing and analyses.
