summary: An interactive workshop on data pre-processing. 
abstract: This session will explore how data pre-processing influences the outcome of a statistical test. After a short introduction, the focus will lie on hands-on exploration of data via a custom-made easy to use Shiny App. Participants get a sense of the impact these pre-processing choices have on the effect of analyses and may even win a small prize for an outstanding analysis. The experience will be contextualised via the results of a related study and the implications for reporting methods and results will be discussed.
