My name is Maximilian Primbs and I´m a first-year PhD student at Radboud University, the Netherlands. Together with Gijs Bijlstra, Rob Holland, Ruddy Faure, and Tessa Lansu I work on situational models of implicit bias - that is the idea that implicit bias resides in situations and not in people. This distinction matters because it determines where and how you need to intervene to successfully reduce discrimination. My other research focusses on the role of stereotypes in visual perception, how they determine how we see emotions and perceive faces. I´m also an avid Open Science enthusiast and engage in research in the field of meta-science and statistics, focussing on data pre-processing and multiverse analysis of reaction time data. Finally, I´m the Assistant Director for Translation and Cultural Diversity at the Psychological Science Accelerator, where I led the translation of the Covid-19 projects to over 40 languages. For a complete overview of all projects, publications, talks and research experience please {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" %}}download my CV{{% /staticref %}}. I´m always happy to collaborate with researchers from all over the globe, so if you think we have shared interests, contact me!
