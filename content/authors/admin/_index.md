My name is Maximilian Primbs and I´m a first-year PhD student at Radboud University, the Netherlands.
In my PhD project I`m investigating how we can best reduce prejudice. My approach is hereby rooted in situational models of bias (e.g., the Bias of Crowds model) - only by understanding and changing the social, cultural, and physical situations bias unfolds in can we facilitate long term reductions in prejudice. In other research lines, I focus on (a) how stereotypes and prejudice affect our visual perception of faces and (b) how we can improve psychological science. 

Additionally, I currently serve as the Assistant Director for Translation and Cultural Diversity at the Psychological Science Accelerator, where I led the translation of the Covid-19 projects to over 40 languages. For a complete overview of all projects, publications, talks and research experience please {{%staticref "files/cv.pdf"%}}download my CV{{%/staticref%}}. I´m always happy to collaborate with researchers from all over the globe, so if you think we have shared interests, contact me!
