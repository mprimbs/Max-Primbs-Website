My name is Maximilian Primbs and I´m a research master student in Behavioural Science at Radboud University, the Netherlands. My research focusses on the effects of stereotypes on visual perception and emotion recognition. Moreover, I´m doing research in the field of meta-science and statistics, particularly on data pre-processing and the proper analyses of reaction time data. I´m the Assistant Director for Translation and Cultural Diversity at the Psychological Science Accelerator, where I led the translation of the Covid-19 projects to over 40 languages. For a complete overview of all projects, publications, talks and research experience please {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" %}}download my CV{{% /staticref %}}. I´m looking for PhD positions in Europe starting around September 2021, please contact me if you can imagine us working together.
